# python-ldap-utility
These are the utilities I created for LDAP interactions while I was brushing up on my Python skills.

I started making this utility with the assistance of https://www.udemy.com/course/ldap-directory-services-concepts-setup-and-configuration/learn/lecture/7264560#overview, which was a Udemy class that I paid for.
